✅ Combined Web Update Prompt:

Make the following updates across the website:

    Design Adjustments:

        Reduce the blur behind the image on the "About Me" page title section so the image colors show through more clearly.

        Update the blue background to maintain visibility while enhancing contrast.

        Center the bottom two sales point boxes on the "Chip Repair for Car Dealerships" page.

        On the same page, change the text "24/7 On Site Mobile Glass Service" to "Flexible On-Site Mobile Glass Service".

        On the "Fleet Service" and "Used Car Service" pages, make the "Email Us" buttons have black text by default and apply a wave-wash hover effect—matching the "Call Us Today" button on the homepage hero section.

        Apply the same hover effect to the "Call Now" button at the bottom of the "Rock Chip Repair Service" page.

        Remove the empty stars before "Trusted by Omaha Drivers" on the "Windshield Chip Repair Services" page.

    Content and Link Updates:

        Replace Boys Town with Bennington in both the Google Maps embed and the footer service area list.

        Change "Need Emergency Auto Glass Service?" at the bottom of the site to "Call Us for Urgent Service".

        Change the "Text Number Now" button to a "Call Number Now" button.

        Route the "Get a Free Quote" button at the bottom of the chip repair page to the /quotes page.

    Quote Page Image and Layout:

        Replace the quote page images:

            "My damage is larger than 6 inches" ➝ newrwin.png

            "I have three or fewer chips/cracks smaller than 6 inches" ➝ newgwin.png

        Zoom into each image so the windshields are fully in view.

    Fleet Page Cleanup:

        Center the middle two sales boxes on the Fleet page.

        Remove the duplicate boxes for "Consolidated Invoicing" and "Maintenance Tracking".

    General Content Clean-Up:

        Remove all mentions of business hours across the website.

        Replace "24/7 Emergency Service" at the bottom with "Flexible Emergency Service".

    Branding:

        Replace the existing logo site-wide with the newly uploaded one.

        Fully remove the old logo from the codebase and asset files.

    Performance Optimization & Stability Measures (Agent Tasks):

        Minify all CSS and JavaScript files.

        Enable lazy loading for images across the site.

        Compress all images without significant quality loss.

        Remove any unused or redundant code files and assets.

        Ensure all external scripts are loaded asynchronously or deferred.

        Verify and fix broken links, outdated imports, or excessive DOM elements.
